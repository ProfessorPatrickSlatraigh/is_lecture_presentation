Information Systems (IS) Lecture Presentations and Notebooks

This repo contains class slides, Google Colab Jupyter notebook(s), and supporting files for an information systems lecture presentation on the use of the Python Folium library for creating geo-spatial maps.  The lectures uses a .csv dataset of information about ferias agricultores (farmers' markets) and feria verde (green market) locations and operating hours in San Jos√©, Costa Rica.  That dataset is referenced with a `!curl` statement where required.   The exercise for the homework assigned in the lecture uses a publicly available dataset of bike rental information from Dublin, Ireland.  That dataset is available on Kaggle.
